# Scorching Sprint

**Scorching Sprint** is a web application/game which is inspired by the classic Chrome Dino game, but has a lot more features.
Users have to create an account and sign in to play the game. Their gameplay data is stored and the highest score is used to rank the players in a global leaderboard.

This project was done by **Swagatam Pati** for the **[2024 Harvard CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/)** online course: **Introduction to the Intellectual Enterprises of Computer Science & the Art of Programming**.

## Technological Design Choices

Here is a list of the various technologies I used in this project:

### Flask
The backend of the application is implemented using Flask. Python Flask is a lightweight and powerful web framework. It stands out for its simplicity, flexibility, and fine-grained control over its components, making it an ideal choice for my project.

### Jinja
Jinja is the templating engine that I used for my project. Jinja is a fast, expressive, extensible templating engine. Special placeholders in the template allow writing code similar to Python syntax. Then the template is passed data to render the final document.

### SQLite & SQLAlchemy
SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine. The ORM used is CS50's implementation of SQLAlchemy which made it possible to work with Python's own objects instead of writing separate SQL queries.

### Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a CSS framework directed at responsive front-end web development. It contains HTML, CSS and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.
